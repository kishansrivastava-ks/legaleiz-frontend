    "A service-level agreement (SLA) is a signed document between a service provider and its customers that specifies the same services to be offered and the service standards that the provider must meet for a determined period of time.",

    "Service providers are required to use SLAs to assist them in controlling expectations of customers and define the risk level and situations under which they are not responsible for outages or poor performance. Customers can benefit from SLAs as well, because the contract describes the service's performance characteristics, which may be equated to the SLAs of other vendors, and creates ways for resolving service issues.",

    "The SLA is one of two fundamental agreements that service providers typically have with their customers. Many service providers draft a professional service agreement to spell out the general policies and procedures under which they will work with customers.",

    "A service-level commitment (SLC) is a broader version of SLA management. A Service Level Agreement differs from a contract in that it is bi - directional and includes two teams. An SLC, on the other hand, is a one-way responsibility that creates what a team can assure its clients at any given time.",
