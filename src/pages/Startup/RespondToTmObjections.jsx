  question: "Trademark Objection",
  answer:
    "Trademark application passes through several stages, where Examination by Registrar is a crucial stage. A competent officer will examine the application and check for any errors or correctness of the application confirming to the Trademark Act and its applicable Rules.\nDuring trademark examination, the Trademark Registrar may raise objections on the applied trademark if it violates rules and laws of trademark registration. It could be due to several reasons like similarity with an existing trademark, offense to a particular religion, absence of a distinct design, etc. In the event of a trademark objection, a comprehensive reply needs to be filed within a month, from the date of issuance of the objection.",
