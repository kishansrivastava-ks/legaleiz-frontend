  question: "Limited Liability Partnership",
  answer:
    "Limited Liability Partnership(LLP) was introduced in 2008, since then it has quickly become a popular legal structure for business. Limited Liability Partnership Registration is governed by the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008. LLP was introduced to provide a form of business that is easy to maintain and to help owners by providing them with limited liability. \nLLP requires fewer compliances and therefore it is preferred by Professionals, Micro and Small businesses that are family owned or closely-held, trading, service sector especially advisory and professional service firms.",
