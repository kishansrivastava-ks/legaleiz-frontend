  question: "GST",
  answer:
    "GST stands for Goods and Services Tax. It's a tax in India that replaced several older taxes like the tax on goods (excise duty) and the tax on services. The law for this tax was made official on 29th March 2017 and started being used from 1st July 2017. Simply put, GST is a tax added when goods or services are sold. It's added at each step of making or selling something and is based on where the item is finally used or bought. This tax is the same for the whole of India.\nGST registration is a crucial step in efficiently running your business. It not only enhances your brand's credibility and authenticity but also ensures your business complies with legal requirements. If a company's annual turnover surpasses Rs. 40 lacs, it is mandated to register as a regular taxable entity under the GST regulations. ",
