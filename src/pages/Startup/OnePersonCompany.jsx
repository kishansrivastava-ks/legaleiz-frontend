  question: "One Person Company",
  answer:
    "Registering a company is the first step to start a business in India. The One Person Company (OPC) is a new form of company formation, introduced in the Companies Act of 2013. \n In OPC, a single promoter gains full authority over the company, he will be the sole shareholder and director (however, a director nominee is present, but has zero power until the real director proves incapable of executing the contract). An OPC is a hybrid structure, it combines most of the benefits of a sole proprietorship and a company form of business. It has only one person as a member who will act in the capacity of a director as well as a shareholder. OPC will give the solo entrepreneur all benefits of a private limited company which means he will have access to credit, bank loans, limited liability, legal protection for business, access to market etc",
